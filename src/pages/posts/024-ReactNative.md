# React Native step one.

Up until now most of what I've talked about has been web based only. Well thats because I only work with web technologies, Html5, Css3, Javascript and React, sprinkle some other things in there as well. Bootstrap, and GatsbyJs which uses GraphQl. 

Now I want to talk about React Native... Why? Well it's simple I do run my own small yet fun online clothing brand and I want to develop an app for it so that in the future I can reach people in different ways and there are a lot of big things I want to do with it that I think an app is going to facilitate perfectly. 

Well now I guess it makes sense I work with ReactJs which React Native runs on well you guessed it ReactJs so in theory any React developer should be able to pick it up pretty quickly and get to work right away on it. 

I'll be honest I'm not the best developer out there in any sense of the meaning. So I don't know the ins and out of React like some developers may and I must say that when I followed my first tutorial on it. There was a lot of things I recognized right away. Granted I'm following along a tutorial so of course it will work as long as you follow it to the T.

I think this is where people get using tutorials wrong. Actually that might be a topic for another post. 

So in React native the tutorial I followed was by Brad Traversy on youtube **[Click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4MJH0jDb4)** it's a simple shopping list app, however it gives you a good walk through of how to set it up and some of the basic components of the app and how it will work. Which to any React developer will look and feel very familiar some things are different like using "view" instead of "div" and the way you link to other "pages" or "routes" is quite a bit different however it makes sense why I mean you are handling the code for two operating systems.

I will do some digging into React Native at a later time. However in the mean time I'm going to step back and work on the basics of React again since as I've stated before I think a strong foundation to anything is the best place to start.
