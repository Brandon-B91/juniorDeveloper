# Getting back to the basics

I think as developers or anyone working in tech we get lost in the "latest", "new" or hottest tech onthe block an sometimes I think we forget how important it is to really keep up on the basics. 

That is where I have been recently is taking a look back at the basics and just refresh it all in my mind. 

Now this will look differntly for everyone if you've been doing this for a year maybe going back and brushing on on vanilla js or css would be a good touch. React developer? maybe just re interate over some es6 or some more obscure parts of React that are not always utilized. 

### Why?

So you might be asking yourself why is this important... Well it's simple really everything needs a strong foundation. 

If you don't know the basics then you can't understand the complex, this is true in all situations, now it is possible that you can work solely with one part of a technology and hamstring yourself into a corner. As a developer the more the more you know the more you're worth so you can negotiate better pay and perks!

### What have I been doing?

Well I recently picked up a small few page website for a local business that I decided to go back to the basics and built it using only HTML5, CSS3 and vanilla Javascript inscluding some es6. I think it has been a very enlightening experience all the way around... No plugins and no automation, just doing everything from scratch. I mean of course I'm using vs code with my favorite plugins but still.

### What did I find?

Well thats the intersting part and I found myself googling some basic things even in html and css which I just have not used in awhile that I had to go and look up on google and even did some stackoverflow surfing which there is nothing wrong with.

### In Conclusion

I have realized that there is a lot of thing I didn't necessarilly forget although I was a bit rusty and needed to look up and refresh on. I have decided I'm going to build my portfolio website in the "basics" like HTML5, Css3 and Javascript.
