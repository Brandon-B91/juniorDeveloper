# My experience with building my own ecommerce site part 2.

Welcome back to part 2 of this little series and the final part as well, if you'd like to catch up on the first one here you can get that [Here](https://www.jrdevsblog.com/snipcart-and-gatsby-part-1/)

## Sumamry

To summarize I was talkiing about some of the small issues I had with snipcart and using it with gatsby, gatsby-plugin-image and programtically creted pages as well some of the small and more obscure issues I had that there was not a lot of documentation on and the work arounds I found.

## In the moment

In this article I'm going to talk more about how it is living with it in an actual live environment.

After playing around it with I really did like how easy it was to plug everything in and getting it to actually work the headaches were there of course but this is part of the process of being / becoming a developer. 

Now that everything is actually up and running and some orders have been placed things are working as expected I have noticied when using lighthouse audit tool it does show that the JS files for snipcart do take up a bit of the preformance, I off set this by just optimizing other parts of the site in order to speed things up a bit.

## What have I been doing with the site 

Lately I've been working on SEO which is a whole animal in its self, there are a lot of free seo tools out there I've come to find that almost all of them tell you somthing different so that isn't too useful. Again SEO in its self can be a full time job so I don't think I'll ever get it perfect or right it is fun to play around with and see if I get different results though.

## Whats next?

Well I've decided on top of ReactJs I'm going to dabble with React native and build an app for fun I'm going to start a series here in the next few days talking about the tutorials I'm going to be doing as well as my thoughts and what I'm learning with it!
