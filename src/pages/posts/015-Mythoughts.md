# My thoughts.

Well this is going to be a little different from all my other posts on ther by far. 

I want to talk retrospectively about this blog the purpose and my thoughts and feelings on web development. 

This blog the main reason I created it was to 
1. learn how to use gatsbyjs and grapqhl (also raect)
2. I wanted to document thoughts and experiences in the field.  

Let's start with the first one I am pretty comforatble able with HTML, CSS and vanilla javascript. I have built a few different websites that are live and some small applications but I felt like I had a good enough understanding of it to move into learning a framework or library. I decided to go with react after doing some research on the job market and after going through some tutorials on vue, angular and react. 

I've wanted to start a blog for sometime to build somewhat of an online presence I didn't want to use a pre existing site like ..tumblr or whatever the case I felt buildling my own would be a good choice so I could one use it to showcase my skils as well as I have full control over what I post and don't have to worry about being moderated. 

As far as the second point this is where it gets a little harder to explain and this might be a small rant so here it goes. It has become easier than ever to become a developer with the rise of online education and learning as well as a lot of companies being more open to accept so called *"self taught"* developers.

The problem with this is now, the competition is now broader in terms of numbers and scope, This in turn means you need to find a way to stand out. So how do you do that when everyone has the same access to online material and resources. Also there is no clear roadmap on where to start and what to do to be on the right track.

My peronsal opinion is you have to be willing to do the things that the other applicants aren't willing to do, build projects that don't have a tutorial on youtube or udemy, or where ever you chose to learn. Tutorials are great for learning the basics  it can even show you how to connect things in ways you might not have understood previously. 

How many applicants out there are just using the tutorisl they found online? if you need to take one and tweak it add features to it and change something layouts make sure you add to this and make it your own add your own touches to it. 

This helps you learn by deconstructing someones work and adding to it your self which is a big part of what you will do working with a team. 

That is my rant on things for the day I know it was a long one thanks for sticking in there The next post I'm going to try to continue on with the tutorial so we can add some styling to it and make it look like a real website.
