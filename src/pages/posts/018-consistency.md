# Building your brand.

I'm sure if you are a new developer or you've been looking into this online or on youtube at one point or another you have come across this "build your brand" I would like to talk about his a little bit more and elaborate on some things that can be done.

Let's break it down. What is a brand? Well your brand is your name and your work it can be as good as a resume or as bad as the plague (okay maybe thats a bad analogy.) So why is that? Well if you have a dedicated following on your Instagram account even if it's small this can be great for potential employers it shows that you're dedicated to your craft and willing to imrpvoe yourself and your skills on your own. 

Things you can do to build your brand.. Let's start with social media we can start with instagram. First determine where you want to start, do you want to do tips and tricks or how to's? Do you want to just document your journey. Once you have decided on this then you can get started. Let's say your' documenting your journey. Start with something that is popular like #100Daysofcodechallenge this is a great place for anyone to start as there is a whole community here to follow and who follows it that can help keep you accountable.

Use a website like ***[Canva](https://canva.com)*** where you can create catchy images for your IG posts or stories. There are other sites you can use as well like.

1. Pixelied
2. BeFunky
3. Adobe Spark

Just to name a few. 

This will really work with all social media that you are using wether it is ***facebook*** or if it is ***twitter*** just keep these same things in mind. 

Next you can look into building your own blog. Now wether you use a site for it now you can use pre exisisting sites that are out there already like.

1. Blogger
2. Tumblr
3. Medium

These have their own pros and cons.

### Pros 

Exisitng userbases which make it easy to get your content out there if it is quality content.

ease of use so you can pretty much just create a login and set up your profile and get going. 

### Cons

On sites like these you don't really own your content so if you violate there terms of service or they shut down well say good bye to all you hard work. 

Depending on your level of expertise you can always build your own site like I did with this one that way you own your domain name you own your content and you have 100% creative freedom over what you can or cannot do and post. 

Of course not everyone will have the ability to do this and that is okay what matters is you do it no matter how you can because it shows initiative shows you have a desire to learn and that you will spend your own time to improve yourself which is never a bad thing. 

There is always youtube, Now this one I don't have personal experience with how ever if you're comfortable being on camera or with showing your your work as well as editing and uploading. Which can come with a learning curve as far as i've been told this is a great way to reach people as well and it's easy for eomployers to see what your capable of. 

Now keep in mind with all of these there are a few keys things to keep in mind. *consistency* is the key here nothing happened overnight and if it does there might be an issue. spend sometime to sit down an create a plan once you create a plan then set out goals for yourself and try to meet them even small goals are worth listing becuase many small achievements amount to great deeds.
