# Css3

What is Css3? well I can go back to my original metaphor of the house! If we think about the web like a house and Html5 is the frame the walls, roof and floor. than Css3 is going to be the wallpaper or paint the carpets and the drapers the coloring of the applainces in the home css is what adds style!

So how does it work? well to put it simply Css is used by selecting the sections specified with the html. Lets say for example if we have something like this.<br>
```html
<h1> this is my header </h1>
```
Well this is going to render just a black header on a white background (assuming that you have done nothing to your page stlying) 

![text that says this is my header in black](../../images/003-images/black-header.png)

so now you want to make this header red instead? well we already have the h1 so with css which will look something like this

```css
h1 {
    color: red;
}
```
With that being done we now will get a header that is red like this.

![text that says this my header in red](../../images/003-images/red-header.png)

So that is a very basic overview of what css3 is and how it works later on we will take a deeper look into how it work and more complex things that can be done with it.
