# introduction part 3

After my last intro I left off talking about some hiccups I had in my early 20's which lead me to quit trying to learn programming. 

if you would like to catch up with where we are now [***Click here***](https://www.jrdevsblog.com/introduction-part-2/) So without further ado.  

Let's fast forward a few years I'll be honest I don't really remember what it is that made me want to get inro programming again it was always something I kept telling myself I would do. I just never took the plunge.

Maybe it was the failing relationship I was in, or the job I had that I hated Maybe I just needed something productive to fill my time aside from hours of video games.

So one day I decide to start looking up programming on **youtube** and come across a few videos a lot of hustle video and how coding will change your life but I wasn't sold just yet.

I decided to look up some "free" code learning platforms which brought me to **[Freecodecamp.com](https://freecodecamp.com)** I figure well I was give this a shot it's free what do I have to lose. I spent some time online and dedcided that I wanted to build for the web... Why? well it does have a relatively low barrier to entry and also with things like react natvie I could also try my hand with rudementary app develop.

So I dive right in any time I'm not working or doing things around the house I'm on **freecodecamp** of course the html was a breese pretty short and to the point. Then came css and I really enjoyed watching what I was typing in there take shape and start to transform the html I wrote previously into something of my own creation.

I think it was maybe a week of really putting in hours into the html and css course and I was already trying to build very basic landing pages spending hours googling and playing with css and html to make small landing pages I wanted. 

So naturally the next step was to go into vanilla javascript and this is when I realized I wanted to do this for a job so I decided it was time to invest some money which I didn't ahve a lot of into my education. I bought a cheap laptop and starting pay $25 a month for a **[teamtreehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com)** memebership and I dove right in.

With this new memebership I'll be honest I started over from square one with html and css just to see if it was any different, and a bit of doubt in myself at this point that I hada good enough grasp on it. I know, I know. A good grasp on html. I wanted to make sure that I was really on par with it though.

The javascipt was intersting the problem I ran into and has been a personal issue of mine is when i learn something  I need to understand why it is that something is happeneing or why it works that way not just that it works.

I found that I will learn something new then google it to figure out why it works that way and it helps make more sense.

This has been a very drawn out post and the introduction part of my blog isn't the most popular, for me it makes sense to explain where I started and how which lead me to where I am.

**Stay tuned for part 4**
