# Introduction

Welcome to *jrDevsBlog*, So let's get statred with the introduction. First off I'm a *"self taught"* web developer, I know the conotations that come with this "phrase", So I've decided with this blog I'm going to document my journey and me experiences with what I've learned and what I am learning.

A bit about me, My name is Brandon and I'm 29 years old and I've decided to take the plunge into becoming a developer so why did I chose this career path? Well it's something I've thought about quite a bit and actually have been interested in since I was a young kid. I remember in my 6th grade computer class the teacher saw I had a tiny bit more experience than the other kids. I think this was due to my mother being an early adopter of cimputers. She took a class to learn how to build them and really be proficient with them, Which in turn I took interest in. Since I lived outside the city I didn't have friends I could just go play outside with. Anyways back on topic here, This computer teacher showed me very basic css inline styling. From there I was hooked sure I know that this is a very small introduction.

**Stay tuned for part 2.**
