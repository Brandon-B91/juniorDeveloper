        Well to put it simply I am lerning web development with no degree. Here comes the buzzword "self-taught", I know this can come with some negative annotations all of it's own. The purpose of this blog is so I can
        document my journey what I'm learning and best practices along the way if any other jrDevs are interested in 
        contrubuting to this then I'd love to talk. Self-taught or traditionally trained, I'd also love to hear from other jrDevs
        You don't have to be in "web" any fields of programming would be good to post on here so if you would like to partiticpate 
        there is a few ways you can reach out to me all my social media is linked. You can E-mail me or leave a comment on one of the posts
        and we can talk!
